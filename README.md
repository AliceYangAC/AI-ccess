# AI-ccess

**AI-powered accessibility microservice** that adapts user interfaces, interprets voice commands, generates image captions, and personalizes experiences for users with diverse needs.

---

## Features

- **Voice Command Interpretation**  
  Uses transformer-based NLP to classify spoken commands and trigger UI actions like theme switching, layout changes, and navigation.

- **Image Captioning**  
  Generates alt text for uploaded images using deep learning models to support screen readers and improve content accessibility.

## Future Enhancements

### Priority

- **UI Adaptation Engine**  
  Dynamically adjusts layout, font size, contrast, and navigation mode based on user preferences or detected accessibility needs.

- **Accessibility Detection**  
  Analyzes user settings (e.g., zoom level, screen reader usage) to infer accessibility requirements and adapt the interface accordingly.

- **Feedback Collection**  
  Captures user feedback to refine personalization and improve accessibility recommendations over time.

### Other Ideas

- Fine-tuned intent classifier for accessibility-specific commands
- Cloud-based speech-to-text integration (e.g., Whisper, Azure Speech)
- Multilingual voice support
